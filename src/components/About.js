        This project began when three people decided to level up their coding skills and join the 
        <a href="https://chingu.io/" >  Chingu Cohorts</a>.  
        Although we had never met we were brought together to build this project as a team. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        And so the journey began. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        For 8 weeks we bridged the distance between the US East, West and Gulf Coasts, and the gap between the 
        skills we had and the ones we wanted to gain. We learned how to use collaborative tools, software, 
        and practices. We learned to support and depend on each other. We got over feeling intimidated by 
        what we didn't know, and we were reminded of the great value of respect for others and 
        ourselves.
        </p>
