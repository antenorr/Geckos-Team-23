        First you'll need to create a category to group your pages
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can have as many categories as you'd like, but every page must belong to a category
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When you visit a web page you'd like to add, right-click and add it to a category
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can customize your experience from the Settings menu.
